            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I grew up in El Dorado, California, as the oldest of six kids. Coming from an entrepreneur home, at the age of fifteen 
                I started my first Etsy business, which gave me some experience interacting with clients and working with them to create one of a kind products.</p>
            <p>I received my AA degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from Folsom Lake Community College in 2015, and from there started running
                Dr. Michael Uro's Laser Center, a branch of a podiatry office, in May of 2016-February 2021. In that roll I daily interacted with patients, booking appointments, taking payments,
            and working with various programs in order to complete paperwork for the office. </p>
            <p>With more time on my hands during the pandemic, I started crafting a blog on sourdough bread in the summer of 2020. That continued to develop and I found that I enjoyed working with
                the Weebly and Wordpress programs.
            </p>
            <p>In 2022 I decided to expand my knowledge of computer programing by taking some courses from an online developing school called <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank" class="card-nav">Treehouse</a>. Through the 
            courses I took, I learned beginning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am continuing to grow in those areas by taking more courses in order to expand my knowledge of programing, becoming a better
            developer.</p>
